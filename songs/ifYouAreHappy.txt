If you're happy and you know it stomp your feet.
If you're happy and you know it stop your feet.
If you're happy and you know it and you really want to show it,
If you're happy and you know it stop your feet.

If you're happy and you know it shout "Horray!"
If you're happy and you know it shout "Horray!"
If you're happy and you know it and you really want to show it,
If you're happy and you know it shout "Horray!"

If you're happy and you know it do all three.
If you're happy and you know it do all three.
If you're happy and you know it and you really want to show it,
If you're happy and you know it do all three!
